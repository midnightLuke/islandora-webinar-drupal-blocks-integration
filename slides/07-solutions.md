# Solutions


## Continue Using Template Overrides

- **PRO**: Not necessarily hard to accomplish
- **CON**: Site builders cannot help
- **CON**: We would need to maintain long-term
- **CON**: Revisions are time-consuming


## Create Custom Blocks for CWRC

- **PRO**: Blocks are place-able in different regions
- **CON**: Logic for roles/cModels hard-coded
- **CON**: Not extensible to new cModels in the future


## Create Islandora "Info Blocks" and Placement Options

- **PRO**: Provides good deal of flexibility
- **PRO**: Code is contribute-able
- **PRO**: Easy to train site-builders to use
- **PRO**: Lots of examples in the Drupal-sphere
- **CON**: Would require development of two new modules
- **CON**: Still requires template modification to remove things

Notes:

- Selected for the contribution potential
- Presented a fun challenge for me personally

# The Problem


## Requirements

- Various cModels would require "citations"
- Addition of "datastream" information, but only for specific roles
- Moving "parent collections" block into the sidebar

Notes:

- CWRC is the "client" in this case


## Islandora Capabilities

- Would need to repeat a lot of code in template overrides
- Post-launch we would need to maintain changes
- Site builders and power users would not be able to customize work later


## Drupal Capabilities

- In Drupal "node options" would make "type-specific" and "role-specific" placement straightforward
- Supplementary blocks that need context are common (ie creating views using
the current node id)
- Site builders can update/maintain blocks post-launch


## BUT

Islandora does not have "cmodel options" or blocks for anything we need...

- So we are back at square one...
